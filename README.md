#Student Management System
The Student Management System is a Django-based web application designed for managing student records. It allows users to create, update, and delete student data using an intuitive web interface. This project demonstrates Djangoâ€™s capabilities in handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with dynamic data management, making it a useful tool for educational institutions.
